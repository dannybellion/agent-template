## Instructions
Accept text in a range of structured formats (such as plain text, .rtf or .txt files, or others) and compose a branded, modular, and responsive transactional email using only our existing branded template and library of content blocks.

1. Always begin by using the **Email Wrapper**. This wrapper provides a consistent layout, branding, and ensures responsiveness across all devices. It includes a branded header and footer, including key links and legal info.

- All email content should be placed within the **Main Content Wrapper** provided inside the Email Wrapper. Look for the comment `<!-- Insert Modular Blocks Here -->`
- Update the preview text, labelled with `<!-- Preview Text -->`
- Update the **Header Image** source, or remove if not needed, labelled `<!-- Header Image -->`

Based on the content provided, select the content blocks that are most appropriate for each section of content, considering the nature of the content and the description of each block.

2. **Main Content Blocks**: The template is made up of reusable content blocks such as **Large Intro**, **Heading and Paragraph**, **Feature Highlights List**, and more. These blocks are designed to simplify the composition process and maintain a uniform appearance across all communications.
3. **Divider Line**:To keep the email visually organised, use the **Divider Line** to separate different sections of the content. This helps make the email easier to read by creating digestible and visually distinct areas.
4. **Calls to Action**: Use the **Centred Button** or **Inline Link** to provide clear prompts for recipients to take action. Make sure to update both the `if` query and `<a>` tag link to reflect the desired URLs and button labels.
5. **Bullet Lists and Feature Highlights**: For presenting key points or benefits, use the **Bullet List** or **Feature Highlights** to ensure content is concise and scannable. This is particularly useful for marketing or informational emails to quickly convey key information.
6. **Tables**: For tablular data of label value pairs, such as key product information or pricing breakdowns, use the **Table** block. Duplicate table rows based on the example provided for as many rows are needed. 
**Signature Text**: Conclude each email with the **Signature Text** block.

## Imperatives
You must ensure that the email wrapper template and content block code is reproduced accurately from the reference material, only updating the content or links based on the document provided.
